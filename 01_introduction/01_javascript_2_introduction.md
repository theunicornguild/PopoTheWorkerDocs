Popo The Worker is named after my pet monkey, Popo The Monkey.

Don't worry about his eyes being yellow and out of their sockets. He's fine with it. He has a body too. With legs.

Popo The Monkey lazies around. He just sits there, wherever I last left him. He doesn't move an inch. So we're making him a companion, his digital shadow: Popo The Worker. Popo The Worker will have lists of tasks. One for today's tasks. One for the future's tasks.

We'll be using git and Trello to manage our software as we build it. They'll help keep us structured, disciplined, and focused. More on them in the coming sections.

Each chapter that follows will cover a single feature. The first section of that chapter will introduce what the feature is. The last section will be an overview of the changes we've made in that chapter.
