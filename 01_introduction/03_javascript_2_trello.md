We'll be using something called [Trello](https://trello.com/). Trello is a tool to manage tasks and can be used to collaborate with a team on those tasks. It's completely free and very elegently built. We created a public board. This board has four lists: `Icebox`, `Backlog`, `Doing`, and `Done`, where each is a list of features to add to the website. Here's what each of them is for:

- Icebox: This is a list for features that are nice to have but not part of the essential features of the app.
- Backlog: This is a list for features that we must do and we're going to do next.
- Doing: This is a list for the current feature we're working on.
- Done: This is a list for the features we've finished building and testing.

We'll walk you through copying [the board](https://trello.com/b/xnQXcNSK/popo-the-worker) to your account and using it to structure our approach to building our Popo.

1. Open the `menu` on the top right corner of the screen
2. Click on "`More`"
3. Click on "`Copy Board`"
4. Give it the name "`Popo The Worker`"
5. Click "`Create`"

Now you'll have a copy of the board over to your account. Moving the cards, adding new cards, and doing anything else on the board after copying it won't affect our public board.
