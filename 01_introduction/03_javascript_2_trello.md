We'll be using something called [Trello](https://trello.com/). Trello is a tool to manage tasks and can be used to collaborate with a team on those tasks. It's completely free and very elegently built. We created a public board ([click here](https://trello.com/b/xnQXcNSK/popo-the-worker)). This board has lists of tasks. We'll walk you through copying the board to your account and using it to structure out approach to building our Popo.

1. Open the `menu` on the top right corner of the screen
2. Click on "`More`"
3. Click on "`Copy Board`"
4. Give it the name "`Popo The Worker`"
5. Click "`Create`"

Now you'll have a copy of the board over to your account. Moving the cards, adding new cards, and doing anything else on the board after copying it won't affect our public board.
