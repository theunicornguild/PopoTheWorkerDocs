We need yarn in our computers in order to create a react app and do everything we need on it. Here are the steps to setup:

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
   ```bash
   $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
   ```
2. Install yarn
   ```bash
   $ brew install yarn
   ```
