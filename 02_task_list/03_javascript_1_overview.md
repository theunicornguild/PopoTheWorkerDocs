Now try adding more tasks in the list, save the file, and you'll see them appear in the page.

Go ahead and take some time to experiment with this page so far. It's ok, we'll wait...

All good?

### Git

Now is a good moment to commit our changes to the project's repository. Run the following commands to add everything, commit, and push:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Tasks list"
$ git push
```
