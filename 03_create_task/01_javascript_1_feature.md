The next step is to let the user create their own tasks. You'll see in the demo a form to create a new task. I know, it looks amazing. You can't handle this much beauty right now, I'm sure the screen is shining like a star. It's dangerous for you. It's ok, we'll work our way up to it.

Move the trello card for this, "User can add new tasks", to the "`Doing`" list.

By this point, the user can view a list of tasks that we create in the code. The user needs a way to create their own tasks. So we'll build a task creation form, a way to access it, and make it add a new task to the list of tasks.
