Popo The Worker is named after my pet monkey, Popo The Monkey.

Don't worry about his eyes being yellow and out of their sockets. He's fine with it. He has a body too. With legs.

Popo The Monkey lazies around. He just sits there, wherever I last left him. He doesn't move an inch. So we're making him a companion, his digital shadow: Popo The Worker.

Popo The Worker will have lists of tasks. One for today's tasks. One for the future's tasks.

### Trello

[Here](https://trello.com/b/xnQXcNSK/popo-the-worker) is the trello board we'll be using to structure our approach to building this app. Copy the board to your account, and we'll walk through moving the cards to the appropriate lists throughout this project.

1. Open the `menu` on the top right corner of the screen
2. Click on "`More`"
3. Click on "`Copy Board`"
4. Give it the name "`Popo The Worker`"
5. Click "`Create`"

Now you'll have a copy of the board over to your account. Moving the cards, adding new cards, and doing anything else on the board after copying it won't affect our board.
