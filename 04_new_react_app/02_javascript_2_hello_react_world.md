Let's do the obligatory introductory "Hello World!" app that you do when you're learning a new techology/language.

In your `src/App.js`, look for and change the following:

```
Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
```

to:

```js
Hello, React World!
```

Save the file and go to the webpage again. Your webpage should refresh automagically and you should see what you wrote appear on the page.

Voil√†!
