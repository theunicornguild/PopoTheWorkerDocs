We're gonna start building this project by cloning the starter repository. This repository contains the starter code we need to work on this project. Let's delete the "Hello World!" app we just made, and clone the starter repo:

```bash
$ cd ..
$ git clone https://github.com/CODEDHQ/popotheworker-starter
```

This command will clone (copy) the project from our repository into your local machine. Next, `cd` into the project, install any necessary packages, and run it:

```bash
$ cd popotheworker-starter
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

Now we're ready to build this popo!
