Our monkey, Popo, is such a dedicated workaholic that he'd like to be able to set the due date for his task to increase his productivity. To do that, we're gonna use a library called [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), and another library called [react-datetime](https://github.com/YouCanBookMe/react-datetime). `react-datetime` uses `Moment` and `React` to work. So this is a nice harmonious melting pot of JavaScript libraries.

Move the trello card "User can set a due date for a task" to the "`Doing`" list.
