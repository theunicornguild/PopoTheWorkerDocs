To keep our monkey focused, let's separate the tasks for today from the tasks for the future. We wanna be able to see the list of tasks due today in their own list called "Today", and any task due in the future in their own separate list called "Future".

Move the trello cards "User can see a list of future tasks" and "User can see a list of tasks due today" to "`Doing`".
