We should organize our code a little better. It's messy and confusing to have the source of data and methods to modify this data in the `App` component. The `App` component is responsible for displaying the app, not for the data in it. The data should have its own place, its own component.

You can see where I'm going with this. Popo's eyes are lighting up with excitement over what's coming!

Also, comparing what we've built so far with the Live Demo, you can see our working monkey needs a makeover, with lots of makeup. Like, so much makeup that he looks like a doll. We want our monkey to look like a doll. So fake people would think he's mass produced, at a factory with so much chemicals that workers there wear gas masks.

In walks Mr. Material Design Bootstrap!
