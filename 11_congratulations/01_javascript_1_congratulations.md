# Congratulations!!

Congratulations on finishing this project! Take a moment to appreciate the website you have just built with React. It's _your_ Popo now. You're more than encouraged to continue developing this project, add any features you'd like it to have, design it however you like, make it yours.

With this project, you learned how to build a todo list app with React. You also now have a basic understanding and proficiency level of React.
