I strongly encourage you to build the Icebox features; the feature cards in the Trello board under the Icebox list. These are features that would be really nice to have on our Popo, but are not essential features to make the todo list function.

You can go to [React's official website](https://reactjs.org/) to learn more about React and learn how to build any feature ideas you have for your Popo.

Best of luck! Farewell!
